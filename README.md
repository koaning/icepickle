> It's a cooler way to store simple linear models.

The goal of **icepickle** is to allow a safe way to serialize and deserialize linear
scikit-learn models. Not only is this much safer, but it also allows for an interesting
finetuning pattern that does not require a GPU.

## Installation

```
python -m pip install icepickle
```
